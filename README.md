# UFO
UFO JavaScript Project Folder
## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this project folder is to create a UFO website with a title, images, styling, and filterable table data that allows for an interactive experience. The user is allowed to filter the data by specifying a date, city, state, country, or "shape". Once filtered, the table data will display only the appropriate results specified by the user
## Results
### Description
To filter the data, the user simply has to specify date, city, state, country, and/or shape. Then the user simply has to hit enter and the table will update. 
### Images
Below is a screenshot of the unfiltered dataset.

Now, when the filter for city is specified as "benton", you can see the table data updates to only display this data:

## Summary
One drawback of this website is that you cannot undo filters once applied. The only way to reset the table data fully is to reload the webpage. You can add multiple filters, even after one has already been specified, but you cannot undo that filter once applied. 
One recommendation to improve the website would be to add an "undo" button that would allow you to undo filters that you have applied or clear all filters so that the user can have more control over what data they are seeing. Another great idea would be to have an option to the export the table data to a CSV so the user can easily perform their own analysis on the dataset.
